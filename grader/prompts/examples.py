MID_BAND_TASK2_ESSAY_QUESTION = """While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?"""
MID_BAND_TASK2_ESSAY_TEXT = """Nowadays, with the development of education, more and more students go to colleges for academic learning. However, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
It is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
Some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.
In conclusion, I think academic study is very much important for students to improve the technology, and the lack of practical workers is not because of less provided vocational training, but the misunderstanding of job between some people."""

HIGH_BAND_TASK2_ESSAY_QUESTION = """Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion."""
HIGH_BAND_TASK2_ESSAY_TEXT = """International sports events require the most well-trained athletes for each country, in order to achieve this goal countries make an effort to build infrastructure designed to train top athletes. Although this policy can indeed make fewer sports facilities for ordinary people, investing in the best athletes is vital to develop competitive sports performances in each country.
On the one hand, building specific infrastructure for the best athletes is crucial in order to get better results at international sports events such as The Olympics or the World Cup. The importance of getting better results is that it creates awareness of the importance of sports in society and motivates more people to do a sport. In this way, investing in these developments can help countries to develop an integral sport policy that can benefit everyone.
On the other hand, one can argue that a negative effect could be that less infrastructure is built for the rest of the people. However, people who practice a sport in their daily life do not necessarily need some facilities to do sports. For example, people often use public spaces to do sports such as running or doing yoga at the nearest park to their home. So, for people who is not top athletes there could be some alternatives for sports facility that ,is not the case for training top athletes.
To sum up, I strongly believe countries should invest in specialised infrastructure for their best athletes because in the long term is going to generate more motivation to do sports, to invest in sports at schools and therefore to build more sports infrastructure for everyone."""
